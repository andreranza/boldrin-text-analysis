*Michele Boldrin* YouTube Channel: a general survey.


## Motivation

The following analysis was carried out to yield some insights on my
preferred YouTube channel: *Michele Boldrin*. In addition, this
small-scale project gave me the opportunity to experiment with the
YouTube API and JSON data structure.

# youtube-api-boldrin

I play with the YouTube Data API to retrive information about my favourite channel: "Michele Boldrin".

The script "data-YT-api.R" is used to interact with the API and to build the dataset, whereas "boldrin-plots.R" contains code of analysis and plots.
